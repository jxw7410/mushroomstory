### FreeRun

### Background and Overview

*FreeRun is a 2d puzzle platform game where the player has to navigate through platforms with the game physics.
*Motivation behind this project is to explore writing code for game physics, as well as creating a light hearted game that anyone can easily pick up and enjoy

### Functionality and MVP features
* Players have the following ability to move left/right and jump off the ground, and walls
* Players can slow down their gravity vector by "sliding" against the walls
* Several stages which gets increasingly tough, but can be solved by exploiting the game physics. There is no one solution, so the user is free to do what they want.
* While there is no score system, there is a time system, so the players can try to best each other through time
* There will be background music, and sound effects for moving, and jumping

### Architecture and Technologies
* HTML5 canvas
* Vanilla Javascript

###Implementation Timeline

##Day 1
 *Implement user controls, and character physics

##Day2
 *Implement particle collision against the obstacle course, particularly the wall sliding
  features 

##Day3
 *Design the stages/levels in which the users can play though

##Day4
 *Continue to work on the stages such as making moving platforms to add some fun to the      game  

##Day5
 *Continue to work on anything that is not complete or glitchy
