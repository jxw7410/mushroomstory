# FreeRun

# Background and Overview
  * Motivation for the project is build a javascript game to learn how to make game physics, and make a light hearted game anyone can enjoy
  * FreeRun is a platform game where the player navigates through platforms using the game physics provided
  
# Functionality and MVP features
  * Player can move left/right, and jump off th floor, and walls
  * Player has to navigate through stages which gets increasingly harder
  * There is no one way to solve an obstacle course, so the player can be creative
  * Stages may require certain interactions to be solvable (A switch has to be set for a door to open)
  * There is no score board, but there is a time stamp which records how long the User took to beat the game
  * There will be music, and sound effects for moving, and jumping
  
# Architecture and Technologies 
  * HTML5 Canvas
  * Vanilla JS

# Implementation Timeline
  ## Day 1
    * Create user controls, and user physics
   
  ## Day 2
    * Create stage physics, and character stage interaction physics
   
  ## Day 3
    * Create the outline for the stages, and make sure they are solvable
   
  ## Day 4
    * Introduce special stage features like moving platforms, and doors
   
  ## Day 5
    * Finish up whatever is not complete
